Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

In this codelab, you'll create a simple mobile Flutter app. If you're familiar with object-oriented code and basic programming concepts—such as variables, loops, and conditionals—then you can complete the codelab. You don't need previous experience with Dart, mobile, desktop, or web programming.

What you'll learn in part 1
How to write a Flutter app that looks natural on iOS, Android, desktop (Windows, for example) and the web
Basic structure of a Flutter app
Finding and using packages to extend functionality
Using hot reload for a quicker development cycle
How to implement a stateful widget
How to create an infinite, lazily loaded list
In part 2 of this codelab, you'll add interactivity, modify the app's theme, and add the ability to navigate to a new page (called a route in Flutter).

What you'll build in part 1
You'll implement a simple app that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates 10 names at a time. As the user scrolls, more names are generated. There is no limit to how far a user can scroll.
